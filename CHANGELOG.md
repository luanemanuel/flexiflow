## **Initial release**

I am pleased to announce the first release of the `flexiflow` package!

This package aims to assist those working with design tools by providing quick and easy ways to build responsive designs and different flows for each device, based solely on the size used for the app's design representation.


### **Features**
- Added a `FlexiFlow` widget that allows to configure the base design size to be used for the app's responsive design.
- Added a `FlowBuilder` widget that allows to customize different flows for each device that you want to support.
- Added a `IFlow` interface that allows to customize the flow for use in the `FlowBuilder` widget.
- Added a `FlowScreen` widget that allows you to use a basic pattern of `mobile`, `tablet` and `desktop` flows, preconfigured for each device using the `FlowBuilder` widget.
- Added a full example of all the features of the `flexiflow` package.
